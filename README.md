# Hide and Seek
#### Designed by: Tim Rusin

## Summary:


Hide and Seek is a single player versus AI type game that was inspired by the Milton Bradley classic board game Battle Ship. I loved this game as a kid and quickly realized it would make a great browser based game.  I also quickly realized how challenging this game would be with all of the  differnt variables to take into consideration.  That being said, I decided to start with a much simpler version of the game by using single player postions on a 4x4 grid.

### Wire-Frame Mock up of the game:

### Stanger Things Inspiration:

Once I added the gameplay music, I felt the game tkaing a bit of a "spooky" turn. This led me to the forest background image and the Red font. I realized imediately that this was beginning to have a Stranger Things vibe to it. So I ran with it.
